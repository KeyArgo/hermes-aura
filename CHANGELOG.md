# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **The server reports the release version.** Its health check said `0.1.0`; it now matches `plugin.yaml`.
- **The version chip tells a release from a development build.** A catalog install of the pinned commit, or a checkout at the release tag, reads `X.Y.Z`; any other build reads `X.Y.Z-dev`. `tools/release_check.py` and the release workflow keep the version, the changelog, the tag and the GitHub release in step.
- **Documentation:** a rebuilt README with a recorded demo and current Hermes Desktop screenshots, and a full docs set (usage, reference, architecture, configuration, troubleshooting, FAQ, development and testing).
- **Project files:** contributing guide, code of conduct, security policy, issue and pull request templates, and CODEOWNERS.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-11-11

First public release.

- **Watch while you work:** a docked film pane for YouTube videos, YouTube playlists and direct
  MP4/WebM, with per-film resume, playlist episodes, auto-skip of unplayable items and a floating
  watch window.
- **A visualiser that listens:** a MilkDrop-compatible WebGL visualiser (Butterchurn, 140 presets)
  driven by system audio, with silence gating, room-following opacity and a calm mode.
- **Agent moods:** thinking, running tools, waiting for approval, erroring, streaming and finished,
  each restoring itself.
- **Agent tools:** `aura_control`, `aura_listen`, `aura_watch`, with keyless YouTube search.
- **Audio capture:** Linux (PipeWire / PulseAudio monitor) and Windows (WASAPI loopback through
  `soundcard`, installed automatically on Windows). macOS needs a virtual audio device.
- **Private by design:** loopback only, never the microphone; audio is analysed in memory and never
  recorded or uploaded.
